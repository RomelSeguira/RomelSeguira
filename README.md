## Hi there 👋

# 🚀 C++ Learning Repository

## About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress as I learn C++ as a first-year Computer Science student.

It contains:
* **Coursework:** Assignments and labs from my C++ programming course.
* **Simple Projects:** Small, self-contained projects built to practice new concepts.
* **Data Structures:** Implementations of basic data structures (like arrays, linked lists) as I learn them.

## 🛠️ Environment

* **Language:** C++
I still got no pc, Im learning through coding c++ application.

## Goal

To build a strong foundational understanding of C++ syntax, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, and efficient algorithms.
